# QuickCart – Simple Shopping Cart Demo

QuickCart is a fictional web project designed to simulate the core functionality of a lightweight online shopping experience. This single-page application allows users to browse products and add them to a virtual cart using basic front-end technologies. The project was developed as part of Assignment 2 in the Mobile Web Development program, focusing on GitHub-based collaboration workflows.

## Description

This assignment emphasizes the use of GitHub Issues, branches, pull requests, and merges to simulate real-world version control and project management. Each update was completed in an isolated feature branch, documented through GitHub Issues, and merged following code review via pull requests. In addition to building a small web interface, the project reinforces collaborative development principles.
